# ReactNative FirebaseSDK method for App authentication

The reason I want to practice other authentication way. Comparing Firebase Auth REST API,the Firebase Admin SDK provides the ability to revoke refresh tokens for a specified user.

In the project, I l practiced how to authenticate to your react native expo mobile device using email id and password. I continue the previouse project `ReactNative-Expo-Firebase-NoteBookProject` I build the siginin and signup to protect the user data. After the Auth setting, the firestore has two collections "user information" and "notes information".

**My learning and practic still continue** üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
